### About Me

Hello, and welcome to my page! I have always been passionate about technology and computers, whether that's building my own PC's, learning HTML/CSS to customize my MySpace page, or programming basic Flash games with ActionScript. After approximately 10 years in the sales industry, I decided to pursue my passion full-time and pivot to a tech/coding-related career.

I am currently attending Code Fellows to learn the skills needed to be successful as a JavaScript Developer.
